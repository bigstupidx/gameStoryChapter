END
 
EntryText:  A telegram arrived for you late last night. An uncle you did not even know you had apparently passed recently. In his will, he left his entire estate to you.
EntryText:  Apparently the estate consists of the home and lands at 15607 Old Hill Rd just outside of town. 
EntryText:  As luck would have it, you had no other plans for the day, so you have decided that you should drive out there and examine your new property. 
EntryText:  Maybe it, or something within, will be worth something to you. At least, you will be able to learn more about this uncle that you did not even know you had.
EntryText:  As you pack your things for a day trip and get into your car, it occurs to you that perhaps before you go out to the house you could do a bit of research to find out more about the place.

Choice:Research the house before going out there.
Action:GOTO:1
Choice:Take the drive out to 15607 Old Hill Rd.
Action:GOTO:20


EntryID:1
EntryText:  Two places within town immediately come to mind. The library and the Arkham Advertiser, the local newspaper. Either might have more information.
EntryText:  At the library, you know you can pour over many old texts about Arkham and its surroundings. It would take some time, but nothing some dogged determination can't handle.
EntryText:  The Arkham Advertiser on the other hand means dealing with the local reporters, editors, or archivists. Getting them to give up information when there is no story to be had will take some convincing.
EntryText:  Of course, you are burning daylight, and you have a bit of a drive ahead of you. Perhaps it would best to skip all this and head out to the house. After all, it is just a house, what more would you need to know than that?

Choice:Nevermind the research. You decide to head out to the house.
Action:GOTO:20
Choice:The library sounds up your speed with its dusty old tomes and research.
Action:GOTO:2
Choice:The Arkham Advertiser is the better choice. If there is information to be had, reporters will know!

Note:Library
EntryText:  You pull up outside the library and step out of your car, just as a thunderclap sounds overhead. Dark storm clouds have been gathering all morning and it looks like they will finally let loose the rain soon.
EntryText:  Managing to get inside just before the rain hits, you settle into to dig through the ancient books and periodicals. The hours go by, and most of what you find is rather dull. Nothing really sparks your interest immediately.
EntryText:  You are reshelving a book on the history of Arkham and its surrounding areas when you get the feeling that something is watching you. You turn to look, but nothing is there but rows upon rows of books. 
EntryText:  Shaking off the feeling you dive back into the search, hoping that something fruitful will turn up soon.

EntryText:  You find one interesting article tucked away in the archives. It is from five years back. Apparently your uncle paid a large sum to Miskatonic University for them to perform an archaeological dig on his land. 
EntryText:  It turns out the land was a former native burial ground. The dig was mildly successful in uncovering several artifacts including a ceremonial mask. 
EntryText:  Unfortunately, before the dig could be completed, things started going wrong. First there was an accident on the site. Then several of the key artifacts were stolen. Eventually your uncle decided to stop funding the dig.

EntryText:  As you reshelve the final book you turn to find a man standing in the shadows of the rack of books ahead of you. Shadows cover his features, and he slowly shakes his head. 
EntryText:  Lightning flashes, and when his face is illuminated, it is a horror to behold. The eyes are sunken in, the skin is taut, and his lips are pulled back in a snarl. You start back as the lightning flash fades and run into a librarian walking through the stacks.
EntryText:  She starts as you bump into her and says, "Oh, terribly sorry. Are you alright?"
EntryText:  You look back to where the figure was standing, but he is gone. Swallowing away the fear, you shake your head and straight your clothes, "Yes, fine, thank you. Excuse me."

EntryText:  You race to the door, the rain slicking your hair to your head. As you get to the door a woman opens it for your from the inside and smiles, "Quickly, come in!"

EntryText:  "It's okay. I didn't really know him. The thing is, he left me the property, and I have no idea what I am getting into."
EntryText:  Julie nods, then leans back in her chair and taps her fingers on the edge of her desk. "As I said, the area is very remote. We could go and check in the archives though. Perhaps we can find something there."
EntryText:  She stands and strides toward the door, grabbing an old massive set of keys on a large key ring from one corner of her desk.

EntryText:  Julie looks you up and down a moment then shrugs, "I can't really say. I don't know anything about that area." She stands, "Now if you will excuse me, I have work to do."

Choice:You leave Julie's office, disappointed.

EntryText:  You lie to Julie. "I was taking a long drive out that direction the other day, and I saw an old house out there. I wondered what its story was."

EntryText:  Julie's eyebrows raise and she looks at you a long moment. "Strange place for a drive." She taps her fingers on the edge of her desk, then shrugs, "I wish I could help you. But that area is very remote. Not much news comes out of that area I am afraid."
EntryText:  She stands and smiles at you. "I appreciate you coming in though. Now if you will excuse me. I have a paper to edit." She walks you to the door of her office, and closes it quietly behind you. 

Choice:You leave Julie's office, disappointed.
Action:GOTO:17


EntryID:16
EntryText:  The archive is in the basement, and Julie clicks on the lights as you head down. They don't really do much to dispel the gloom downstairs, but at least you don't run into things. Julie walks over to one door, and uses one of the keys on a massive keyring to unlatch the heavy old door. 
EntryText:  Once it is open she slips in, clicking on another light, then turns to rows and rows of boxes. "Let's see. I think... ah yes. Here we go." She pulls a box off one shelf and starts leafing through things. "I remember there was something out there several years back. Had to do with the University." She flips through many sheafs of paper before finally stopping on one and handing it to you. "There you go."
EntryText:  The article outlines how your uncle paid for an archaeological dig on his land. Apparently a prehistoric burial ground was located in the woods behind the house, and your uncle worked with Miskatonic University to have it excavated. The dig went well for a while, producing several rare artifacts, including a ceremonial mask. Things started to fall apart though, after an accident at the dig site left one worker dead, and a break in at Miskatonic University resulted in the theft of most of the major artifacts. Your Uncle pulled the plug after that.

EntryText:  Julie smiles, "I wish I had more for you, but that is really all the detail there is from then."
EntryText:  You go over the article one more time, scanning for anything else that will tell you anything, but it is mostly generalities and reactions from locals and University officials.
EntryText:  "I really appreciate this, Julie." You smile and hand her back the article. She refiles it, then clicks the light off as you both turn to walk out of the archives. 
EntryText:  "I hope it was enough. I appreciate you stopping by, but I really need to get back to work." She offers you a hand which you take, and then turns to walk away.

Choice:You head out.
Action:GOTO:17


EntryID:17
EntryText:  You step out into the rain and begin toward your car. Glancing to one side, you see a shadow slip back into an alleyway beside the paper. Something tells you, whoever it was, they were watching you.
EntryText:  Slamming your car door shut, you start the car and drive passed the alley. Standing in the back of the alley, drenched in rain and covered in shadow is a hooded figure, watching you intently. You stop the car, and step out, determined to confront the man. 
EntryText:  Lightning flashes, and in the brighter light, you swear that the man's face is covered in something. The eyes are massive, the lips curled in a snarl. It must be a mask. Right?
EntryText:  As you eyes readjust to the light, you step forward, "You there!" You begin toward the figure just as they turn to one side, running from sight. You make the corner fast enough, feet splashing through the puddles as you run. 
EntryText:  When you turn the corner though, no one is there. You look up the sides of the buildings, and back the way you came, but see no signs of the masked figure. 

Choice:You take a breath, then head back to your car and out of the rain.
Action:GOTO:20

EntryText:  "Thank you so much, you are too kind." You look around her office as she closes the door. "Nice office you have here, Julie. You must work very hard."
EntryText:  Julie smiles her appreciation and nods, "I do. It's not easy to get ahead in this business, but my family has owned the Advertiser for generations, so I guess it is just in my blood."
EntryText:  You nod, "Well family business or not, I can tell you care for it." 
EntryText:  "Enough about me, what can I do for you?" She settles into her office chair. 
EntryText:  "I am interested in the history of the area out off of Old Hill Rd. I was hoping with your connections you might be able to help me."
EntryText:  "I am familiar with the area, yes." She stands and grabs a large ring of keys off her desk. "Let's go down to the archives and see what I can dig up."

Choice:You follow Julie to the archives.

EntryText:  Julie frowns, "Like me?"
EntryText:  You try to correct for your obvious mistake. "I just didn't expect the editor of the local paper to be..."
EntryText:  Julie cuts you off, "My family has owned the paper for generations. I grew up here, and I'm the best one qualified to run it."
EntryText:  "Of course, I didn't mean to offend. I was just surprised." Julie regards you a long moment before leaning back and sighing. 
EntryText:  "It's alright. I get it a lot. I do have a lot of work to do though, so I am afraid you will have to excuse me." she stands and opens her office door, clearly ending the conversation.

Choice:You leave Julie's office, disappointed at your lack of progress.
Action:GOTO:17


EntryID:20
Note:Drive to house, rain stops, hear noise around back, front door or head around back?
EntryText:  The drive takes a while. Old Hill Rd is the far outskirts of the county. The rain stops about five minutes before you pull up at the house, but the clouds stay gathered and low, making for a gloomy drive.
EntryText:  Finally you pull up outside the house. The gate to the road is open, so you pull into the long drive. The gate itself is in need of repair. The stone pillars on either side are cracked, with masonry crumbling off the top of the right one. 
EntryText:  You pass a tangle of trees, finally catching sight of the house itself. It is in about the same condition as the drive gate. Massive vines snake up the side of the house, bushes in desperate need of trimming crowd the base, and old trees, stretch toward the house as if trying to one day reach inside. 
EntryText:  The drive ends in a small circle up front, with a separate drive stretching around the house to the back. You park and step out, looking around. Behind the house you can here something going on. A rhythmic thud sounds now and again, as well as the clattering of something falling. The
EntryText:  The front door stands ahead of you, shadowed by the old porch which sags slightly on one side. 

Choice:Go to the front door.
Action:GOTO:21
Choice:Go around back to find out what the noise is.
Action:GOTO:30


EntryID:21
Note:Front door, can try to open it, or knock.
EntryText:  You step up onto the creaking floorboards of the front porch. Inside the house, you hear something scrambling around, then the deep barks of a what you assume is a large dog. 
EntryText:  The door is fairly solid looking, though the entire house looks like it could use a coat of paint and some general maintenance. A massive knocker hangs on the door, the large metal ring set into the mouth of a gruesome looking gargoyle face.
EntryText:  You could use the large old metal knocker on the door, though the dog has probably alerted anyone inside of your presence. You were not really expecting anyone to be here, but the dog is obviously being cared for by someone.
EntryText:  You could also just try to open the door, dog or no dog.
EntryText:  Finally you could still go around back and find out what the noise you were hearing back there was.

Choice:Knock on the door.
Action:GOTO:22
Choice:Try to open the door.
Action:GOTO:23
Choice:Walk around back.
Action:GOTO:30


EntryID:22
EntryText:  You reach up and grab the large metal ring and give it a few swift raps against the metal plate beneath the gargoyle head. The dog inside barks louder than before, as if the use of the knocker just angers it further.
EntryText:  You wait several minutes, but no one comes to answer the door. The dog never gives up its attempts to scare you away though.

Choice:Try to open the door. You can handle the dog.
Action:GOTO:23
Choice:Walk around back.
Action:GOTO:30

Note: Trying the handle
EntryText:  You reach down for the handle, ignoring the deep sounds of the barking dog on the other side of the door. You attempt to turn the knob, but nothing happens. 
EntryText:  It's locked.

EntryText:  You rear back and kick the door near the handle. The door is really solid, but the frame it is set in must not be, for it splinters and the door slams open. 
EntryText:  It hurts for a moment, but you quickly get over it when you see the massive dog come lunging out of the darkness behind the door.
EntryText:  You stumble back, falling off the porch with a yelp. Before you can react the dog is on you. You manage to thrust you arm in the way of its massive jaws, preventing it from biting your face off. 
EntryText:  It sinks its teeth into your arm and begins to shake. You scream in pain and punch the dog in the side of the head over and over until it finally relents and lets go. 
EntryText:  Just as it looks to be gathering steam for another lunge at you, a man behind it grabs its collar and yanks it backwards. He is older and gritty looking, carrying an axe in one hand, manhandling the massive dog with the other. He spits to one side then growls, "Wondering when you were going to show up."

Note: Walk around back, see the caretaker cutting wood, interrupt him. He strides up...
EntryText:  You walk around the back of the building along the secondary drive. Behind the house a small shack sits nestled against the forest, lights on inside. In front of the shack stands a man with an axe. 
EntryText:  As you watch he sets a section of a log on large block of wood and then swings the axe. With a loud thunk, the axe splits the wood with ease and the two pieces of wood clatter to the earth on either side. Without missing a beat he yanks the axe out and repeats the process.
EntryText:  With each sharp thwack of the axe, the man easily splits large logs with a practiced ease. You get the uneasy feeling you would like to never get on the business end of that axe. 
EntryText:  You shudder at the gruesome thought, then call out, "Excuse me."
EntryText:  He doesn't miss a beat, axe falling to split another log even though he is now looking at you. "What?"
EntryText:  "I don't mean to intrude, but I need a word with you." He spits to one side of then chokes up on the axe and strides toward you.

Note: Talking to the caretaker. 
EntryText:  "I'm James, the caretaker of the property." He sets the axe aside and looks you up and down. 
EntryText:  You begin to introduce yourself, but he interrupts, "I know who you are. Who do you think sent you the telegram? Your uncle was a fair boss, and he left me the shack behind the house. I'll continue to take care of the house and grounds as best I can."
EntryText:  Nodding you ask him, "What about the inside of the house? Who took care of that?" You stare up at the large building wondering what it was your uncle actually did.
EntryText:  "That would just be you. Your uncle only had one really strict rule. No one in the house but himself. Ever. I've never set foot in the place. Don't see any reason to change that now. Besides. The place creeps me out." 
EntryText:  In the distance there is a flash of lightning and the rumble of thunder. James stares at the sky over the top of the trees around the house. "I'll get the dog out of your way, and then you better get inside. There is a storm coming. You don't want to get caught unprepared. Oh, and here are the keys." He hands you a large set of keys to the house.
EntryAction:GRANT_ITEM:House Keys:smallItemSample:smallItemSample:This set of keys is for the house at 15607 Old Hill Rd outside of Arkham, Massachusetts. They are sturdy, old keys, made for the old locks of the house.

EntryText:  You look through the things on the shelves. The jars contain a weird assortment of random things. Most of them look like animal parts, but the names of the animals you don't recognize. You pick one up and shake it slightly and the within the suspension inside, a claw of some sort rotates slowly. Another jar contains what looks to be some sort of eyeball. You tap it and the liquid inside sloshes slightly, causing the eyeball to rotate more toward you.
EntryText:  You move on to the books, and begin to examine them. The collection of title is very odd. References to cryptozoology, mythology, as well as some classics and more modern fare mingle all together in an eclectic collection. The fiction all leans toward the dark side, certainly not the sort of thing you would choose to curl up next to the fire with. One book is older than the rest, and when you flip it open, you don't recognize the symbols that you see.

EntryText:  You take the book over and sit down in the large chair. You imagine that your uncle must have sat here, probably with this very book. The fact that you never knew him and now own this whole place weighs on you for a bit, but then you push the thoughts aside and flip open the book again. 
EntryText:  The symbols still make no sense to you, but you keep flipping through the book, interested nonetheless. In the middle of the book you find a larger page that folds out from the rest of the book. A massive symbol is drawn on the page, with three concentric circles on it. Arrows drawn on the circles indicate counterclockwise rotation on the outer most circle, clockwise rotation on the middle circle, and clockwise rotation on the inner circle. 
EntryText:  In the middle of all the circles there are picture two ovals or sockets. The one on the left is filled in, the one on the right is empty.
EntryText:  Finally there is a stick figure drawn with an arrow pointing away from it.

EntryID:61
EntryText:  The phonograph is several decades old. A single record without a label sits on the phonograph. Scratched into the center where a label might be are some crude symbols that look more like runes than letters.
EntryText:  You check, and the phonograph is plugged in and getting power.

EntryText:  The recording is very scratchy. A man's voice is heard first.
EntryText:  "Will you play for me?"
EntryText:  A softer voice, female it would seem responds, "I would prefer not to. You know I don't like it."
EntryText:  "Please, Caroline. Just one more time. For me." There is a long pause, then some rustling, before a piano begins to play. The tune is slow, and haunting at first. Then it begins to pick up in tempo.
EntryText:  Caroline whimpers, as the playing seems to get harder. You can hear even through the rough sound of the recording the physical sound of the keys being hammered on. The tempo of the music gets faster, and faster.

Choice:That's enough of that, turn it off.
Action:GOTO:63
Choice:Let it play. It is after all, just music.
Action:GOTO:64


EntryID:63
EntryText:  You yank the arm of the phonograph up, a scratching sound echoes as the needle scrapes the record. 
EntryText:  The silence that follows is almost too completely. The noise that moments ago filled the air seems almost preferable to the sudden silence. 
EntryText:  You realize you had been holding your breath and let it out with a sigh, shaking from your head the thoughts of what you just heard.

EntryText:  You can hear now that Caroline is in physical pain as she continues to play. She hammers on the keys, and the music reaches a level of discord and frantic nature.
EntryText:  Louder and louder, faster and faster it goes, when a howling wind is picked up by the recording. "You are doing it Caroline, keep playing!" yells the man's voice. 
EntryText:  She screams over the howling wind and discordant cacophony of the piano. "No! Make it stop! I can't stop!" The howling wind ends with a massive roar, the piano falls silent, Caroline and the man both scream in terror.
EntryText:  There is a horrid crunching noise, and the man's scream ends abruptly. The crunching noises continue along with horrid slurping noises.

EntryText:  There is a low chuckle as the crunching and slurping continues. Caroline's voice is heard again, this time it is far more sultry and soothing, "There you go."
EntryText:  "Eat up my darling. Enjoy the meal." She laughs low and begins to play the piano again, this time softly, and almost playfully. The crunching and slurping noises pause for and a soft mewling growl is heard. "Yes, I know. I tried to warn him. But he didn't listen. They never listen."
EntryText:  You swallow hard as the recording ends with Caroline laughing, joined by a deep guttural laugh. The needle finally reaches the end of the record and it begins to skip slowly, scratching noises coming from the phonograph as it continues to spin.
EntryText:  Finally you reach up and lift the arm of the phonograph off, and turn the the phonograph off. Your eyes dart around the room, and you realize you've been holding your breath slightly so you let it out. 
EntryText:  Then you see it. 
EntryText:  In one corner one of the cloths rests over what could only be a piano. You look back down at the massive stain in area in front of the piano. Your mind revolts at the possibilities and you quickly flee the room back to the foyer, trying not to be sick.

Note: Kitchen
EntryText:  You find yourself in the kitchen of the house. Most of the cupboard cabinets are open and bare. The few that are not you search through and find empty.
EntryText:  Laying on the counter next to the sink is a large knife, but it is obviously not a kitchen knife. It has a wooden handle carved to look like an animal's paw. The wood looks very old and aged. Some sort of dark liquid has unevenly stained the wood in places.
EntryText:  The blade of the knife is around eight inches long, with an edge on just one side. It sweeps back on the edge side to a sharp point. The back side of the blade has a groove in it. Caked in the groove is what looks to be dried blood. Perhaps that is what stained the handle as well.

EntryText:  Within all the stuffing you find a lump of something pulpy, and when you poke it, it begins to inch away. It's a massive maggot like creature, some six inches long and four inches around.
EntryText:  The smell it gives off when it moves is revolting, and its flesh undulates as it inches away from you and back into the mass of stuffing.

EntryText:  Unusual creatures, people in strange outfits, and other odd shapes are depicted in the decoration on the edge of the mirror.
EntryText:  The mirror itself has a bit of a wave to the glass and is a bit clouded, so the reflection is a warped and darker version of reality.
EntryText:  You study yourself in the darkened reflection and for a moment you find yourself smirking at the dark image. You imagine yourself a dark god, watching over his people.

Note: Book
EntryText:  The book seems to be a journal. Your uncle's name is written inside the cover. You flip through a few pages and begin to read, hoping to glean information about your uncle.
EntryText:  Most of the days detailed in the journal discuss your uncle doing research, or exploring the woods. He often refers to someone or something as 'them' but never elaborates on who they are.
EntryText:  Whoever it is, they apparently scare your uncle, because he talks about installing protections from outsiders like 'them'. He talks of 'they' want what he acquired, and he rails against the unfairness enacted upon him by 'them' when all he wants is to be left alone.
EntryText:  In one entry he even says if he dies, it will likely be at their hands.
EntryText:  Tucked into the book is a small handwritten note. It is in a language you don't understand. Written beneath it in English seems to be a translation. It says, "I finally understand how time works. 12-12, stop."

EntryText:  As your eyes shut, you begin to doze off a bit. You see a large empty plane stretch out before you. When you turn to look behind you a massive stone structure with impossible angles sits before you. 
EntryText:  A deep voice growls out a word you do not understand, it echoes from within the impossible building. Your eyes snap open, and like that, the word escapes your memory.

Note: Basement
EntryText:  You open the door to the basement and stare down the steep steps into the darkness. You click the switch at the top of the steps and the light momentarily lights the stairs before a loud pop sounds and the light dims then quickly goes dark. 
EntryText:  Pulling the oil lantern out you light it and twist the knob to adjust the flame to the right height. Finally ready you head down the steps and into the basement. 
EntryText:  Dust and dirt gathers in the gloomy corners of the basement, and a rat crawls quickly out of your light and through a hole in the wall. The room empty save a large metal door set in one wall.
EntryText:  Stepping up to the door you see beside it a large decorative metal mechanism built into the wall. There are no handles or latches on the door. In the middle of the mechanism is a large metal skull with dark green crystals for eyes. The skulls mouth is open wide, and by lifting the lamp just right, you can see that there is a lever deep within the hole. You would have to reach almost your entire arm in to reach the lever. Slots line the bottom of the hole, and small holes like the top of it.
EntryText:  Around the skull are three concentric rings. Each is carved with decorative symbols. The outer ring seems to be decorated with symbols of the sun. The middle ring is decorated with symbols of the moon. The inner ring is decorated with fire symbols. Each of the rings has a small handle, and looks like they can spin either direction.

EntryText:  The time it took was too costly though. The manacles slam around your wrists, the spikes piercing your skin. Your screams echo through the chamber, mixing with the laughter of the children.
EntryText:  The manacles pull hard at you, pulling you back to the against the wall.

EntryText:  As quickly as it all began, it all ends. The doll slumps back to lifelessness, the manacles snap open, and you are left, bleeding and in pain, wondering what just happened.
EntryText:  The children's laughter ends, and slowly echoes away into silence.
EntryText:  Stumbling away from the wall you look down at the hole and see that it is once again dry, your blood having been turned into yet another dark stain.

EntryText:  The manacles are made of sturdy thick iron. Time has worn a few pock marks in them, and rust is evident in a few places, but they are still very sturdy.
EntryText:  The inside of the cuffs of the manacles each contain four two inch spikes. Your wrists hurt just looking at them. The spikes have dried dark stains on them. You decide to leave them alone.

Choice:Examine the table.
Action:GOTO:113
Choice:Examine the doll.

EntryText:  You go over and look at the doll. It is a cloth body doll, with a wooden carved head. If it had clothes, they are missing now. The head is worn, and chipped. The paint on one eye is starting to fade, making it look different than the other eye.
EntryText:  The body of the doll is stained and worn, the stuffing inside has compacted over the years, so now the skin of the doll hangs far looser than it should. 
EntryText:  Something about the doll just gives you the creeps. It could be the old faded paint, or the worn stained body. Or maybe it is the fact that it is a doll, in what looks to be a dungeon. Either way, you decide to leave it be.

EntryText:  The grandfather clock is rather massive. It is seven feet of ancient carved wood, gears, pendulums, and fine craftsmanship. The carvings are very gothic in nature, and the face is very ornate.
EntryText:  After studying it for a few minutes though, you realize that something is off about the pendulum. It seems to be swinging further to right than to the left. This makes every other tick of the clock slightly longer.
