EntryText:  The year is 1925.  
EntryText:  A telegram arrived for you late last night. It informed you of the death of Gerith Coleman, an uncle you did not even know you had. In his will, Jerith left his entire estate to you.
EntryText:  Accord to the telegram, the estate consists of the home and lands at 15607 Old Hill Rd just outside of Arkham Massachussets. You live in Arkham, so it is a fairly short drive out to the area of Old Hill Road. 
EntryText:  You are not familiar with the area, but you know where it is, and as luck would have it, you had no other plans for the day. Therefore, you decided that you should drive out there today and examine your new property. 
EntryText:  Maybe it, or something within, will be worth something to you. At least, you will be able to learn more about this uncle that you did not even know you had.

Choice:Take the drive out to 15607 Old Hill Rd.
Action:GOTO:1


EntryID:1
EntryText:  You begin the drive out to the house under overcast skies, and soon enough the heavens part and the rain begins to pour down. Your visibility is poor, and the road conditions worsen as you go.
EntryText:  Old Hill Road cuts off a county road and you quickly find yourself creeping down what would better be called a muddy track than a road.
EntryText:  The trees to either side of the road reach out over the muddy track. They do nothing to really protect from the rain in their current leafless state in late autumn.
EntryText:  Now and then a wind picks up, blowing some of the fallen leaves across the road. Its the only real movement you've seen in some time. No one seems to care to come out this way, and you have not seen another car for the last several miles.

Choice:Continue
Action:GOTO:20


EntryID:20
Note:Drive to house, rain stops, hear noise around back, front door or head around back?
EntryText:  The rain finally stops just before you pull up at the house, but the clouds stay gathered and low.
EntryText:  You pull up at the address. A long driveway through an open gate leads back to the house. The gate itself is in desperate need of repair. The stone pillars on either side are cracked, with masonry crumbling off the top of the right one. With a bit of a sigh you pull into the drive.
EntryText:  Driving through a tangle of trees, you finally catch sight of the house itself. 
Choice:Continue
Action:GOTO:2001


EntryID:2001
EntryImage:house512
EntryText:  It's in about the same condition as the drive gate. Massive vines snake up the side of the house with bushes in desperate need of trimming crowd the base. Old trees stretch toward the house as if trying to reach inside. 
EntryText:  In front of the house is a small circular parking area, with a separate drive stretching around the back. You park and step out, looking around. Behind the house you can here something going on. A rhythmic thud sounds now and again, as well as the clattering of something falling.
EntryText:  The front door stands ahead of you, shadowed by the sagging old porch. 

Choice:Go to the front door.
Action:GOTO:21
Choice:Go around back to find out what the noise is.
Action:GOTO:30


EntryID:21
Note:Front door, can try to open it, or knock.
EntryText:  You step up onto the creaking floorboards of the front porch. Inside the house, you hear something scrambling around, then the deep barks of a what you assume is a large dog. 
EntryText:  The door is fairly solid looking, though the entire house looks like it could use a coat of paint and some general maintenance. A massive knocker hangs on the door, the large metal ring set into the mouth of a gruesome looking gargoyle face.
EntryText:  You could use the large old metal knocker on the door, though the dog has probably alerted anyone inside of your presence. You were not really expecting anyone to be here, but the dog is obviously being cared for by someone.
EntryText:  You could also just try to open the door, dog or no dog.
EntryText:  Finally you could still go around back and find out what the noise you were hearing back there was.

Choice:Knock on the door.
Action:GOTO:22
Choice:Try to open the door.
Action:GOTO:23
Choice:Walk around back.
Action:GOTO:30


EntryID:22
EntryText:  You reach up and grab the large metal ring and give it a few swift raps against the metal plate beneath the gargoyle head. The dog inside barks louder than before, as if the use of the knocker just angers it further.
EntryText:  You wait several minutes, but no one comes to answer the door. The dog never gives up its attempts to scare you away though.

Choice:Try to open the door. You can handle the dog.
Action:GOTO:23
Choice:Walk around back.
Action:GOTO:30


EntryID:23
Note: Trying the handle
EntryText:  You reach down for the handle, ignoring the deep sounds of the barking dog on the other side of the door.  
EntryText:  A quick check reveals that the front door is locked. 
EntryText:  When you were notified of your inheritance, there was no real communication about actually taking ownership. You don't have a key, and really have no idea how you will get one.
EntryText:  You walk over to one of the windows on the porch and cup your hands against it, trying to see inside. It's no use, you can't see in through the grime on the window. Even if you could, you think you see that the curtains inside are closed.

Choice:Try kicking the door down.
Action:GOTO:24
Choice:Knock on the door.
Action:GOTO:22
Choice:Walk around back.
Action:GOTO:30


EntryID:24
Note:Kicking it down, dog attacks, caretaker comes in, grabs the dog, 
EntryText:  You rear back and kick the door near the handle. The door is really solid, but the frame it is set in must not be, for it splinters and the door slams open. 
EntryText:  It hurts for a moment, but you quickly get over it when you see the massive dog come lunging out of the darkness behind the door.
EntryText:  You stumble back, falling off the porch with a yelp. Before you can react the dog is on you. You manage to thrust you arm in the way of its massive jaws, preventing it from biting your face off. 
EntryText:  It sinks its teeth into your arm and begins to shake. You scream in pain and punch the dog in the side of the head over and over until it finally relents and lets go. 
EntryText:  Just as it looks to be gathering steam for another lunge at you, a man behind it grabs its collar and yanks it backwards. He is older and gritty looking, carrying an axe in one hand, manhandling the massive dog with the other. He spits to one side then growls, "Wondering when you were going to show up."

EntryID:30
Note: Walk around back, see the caretaker cutting wood, interrupt him. He strides up...
EntryText:  You walk around the back of the building along the secondary drive. Behind the house a small shack sits nestled against the forest, lights on inside. In front of the shack stands a man with an axe. 
EntryText:  As you watch he sets a section of a log on large block of wood and then swings the axe. With a loud thunk, the axe splits the wood with ease and the two pieces of wood clatter to the earth on either side. Without missing a beat he yanks the axe out and repeats the process.
EntryText:  With each sharp thwack of the axe, the man easily splits large logs with a practiced ease. You get the uneasy feeling you would like to never get on the business end of that axe. 
EntryText:  You shudder at the gruesome thought, then call out, "Excuse me."
EntryText:  He doesn't miss a beat, axe falling to split another log even though he is now looking at you. "What?"
EntryText:  "I don't mean to intrude, but I need a word with you." He spits to one side of then chokes up on the axe and strides toward you. 
EntryText:  You swallow then straighten your clothes and move to meet him.
Choice:Continue.
Action:GOTO:31
Action:STOP_SOUND


EntryID:31
Note: Talking to the caretaker. 
EntryText:  The man frowns at you, then sighs, "I'm James, the caretaker of the property." He sets the axe aside and looks you up and down. 
EntryText:  You begin to introduce yourself, but he interrupts, "I know who you are. Who do you think sent you the telegram?" He studies you a moment longer then turns away, "Welcome to your new house."
EntryText:  "Thanks, I guess..." You are not sure what to say next, so you add, "I really didn't know my uncle at all..."
EntryText:  James turns back to look at you again, then shrugs slightly. "He was a fair boss, and he left me the shack behind the house. I'll continue to take care of the house and grounds as best I can."

Choice:Continue.
Action:GOTO:32


EntryID:32
EntryText:  Nodding you ask him, "What about the inside of the house? Who took care of that?" You stare up at the large building wondering what it was your uncle actually did.
EntryText:  "That would just be you. Your uncle only had one really strict rule. No one in the house without him. Ever. I only ever open to the door to let the dog in and out. Don't see any reason to change that now. Besides. The place creeps me out." 
EntryText:  In the distance there is a flash of lightning and the rumble of thunder. James stares at the sky over the top of the trees around the house. "I'll get the dog out of your way, and then you better get inside. There is a storm coming. You don't want to get caught unprepared. Oh, and here are the keys." He hands you a large set of keys to the house.

Choice:Head inside before the storm comes.
Action:GOTO:50


EntryID:50
Note: Exploring the house.
EntryText:  The keys to your new home finally in hand, you step to the door. 
EntryText:  You turn from the two and look to the door. 
EntryText:  You look down at the set of keys and have to try one or two before you find one that finally fits the lock. You have to work at it a moment, as the old lock sticks, but finally you get it open. 
EntryText:  James takes the dog by the collar and drags him toward the shack out back. The entire time the dog barks and growls in your direction. James cuffs it with his free hand, "Shut up." The dog doesn't seem to notice.
EntryText:  Finally, you step inside, looking around. The place has definitely seen better days.

Choice:Continue
Action:GOTO:51


EntryID:51
EntryText:  You are in the foyer. Everything here is worn and old. The hardwood is scratched, the plaster is peeling from the walls, and the few bits of furniture are covered in dust, and in disrepair.
EntryText:  The area is musty, and you can tell by the smell that the dog spends a good bit of time here. Tracks in the dust on the floor show patterns of traffic between the rooms, but in the corners the cobwebs and dust gather.
EntryText:  Off to the left of the door is a sitting room, to the other side a large study. Ahead of you there is a massive staircase that leads up the second floor landing. A door beside the staircase hangs open and obviously leads to the back of the house. 

Choice:Head into the sitting room.

Note: Study
EntryText:  Unlike the other areas on the ground floor of the house, this room looks like it has actually been used. One wall is covered in built ins and a large fireplace. In front of it sits a large comfortable chair with a small side table.
EntryText:  Beside the chair sits a small oil lantern. Its handle is well worn, and the it seems to have gotten plenty of use.
EntryText:  The bookshelf built around the fireplace is mostly bare, but one section is covered in old books. Another shelf contains several jars and other knick knacks.  

Choice:Light a fire in the fireplace and have a rest.

EntryID:56
EntryText:  You spend a few minutes lighting a fire in the fireplace. It warms the room and lights it well. You almost feel comfortable for the first time today.
EntryText:  Sitting down in the chair, you think over all that you have seen today. You know that the day is far from over, and you get the sense that you have just scratched the surface of what the house has to offer, and how owning it will change your life.
EntryText:  After few moments of contemplation, your eyelids get heavy and drift off to sleep.

Action:GOTO:561


EntryID:561
EntryText:  You find yourself standing on the bow of a large steam ship. The water churns below you, parting to let the ship glide through. Ahead fog and mist make it hard to see. 
EntryText:  The ship suddenly lurches and you are thrown into the railing ahead of you. When you grab the rail to steady yourself, you don't recognize the hands you see. The left hand has a large scar across the back and the hands are older than yours. You also don't recognize the clothing you are wearing.
EntryText:  The ships horn sounds, a loud crashing noise that makes you clap your hands over your ears. There are yells and cries from elsewhere on the ship. Then you hear it, a roar, or a yell or something... undescribable coming from in front of the ship.

EntryText:  Looking out you see the sea is boiling and forthing and jutting forth from it some 100 yards before the ship is a massive form, at least a hundred feet high sticking up from the water. Its huge head is vaguely octopus shaped. It body looks vaguely human, with dark greenish skin.  

Choice:Flee from the sight in front of you.
Action:GOTO:562
Choice:Watch the creature.
Action:GOTO:563


EntryID:562
EntryText:  Turning to flee you see men all staring up at the thing. In the middle of them all is a young woman who is smiling up at the creature, a look of rapture on her face. You stumble forward and grab a hold of her shoulders and shake her as she begins to laugh out loud. 
EntryText:  A voice that is not your own cries out from your mouth, "Caroline, we must flee this place!"
EntryText:  She shakes her head and grabs your hands, "Why father, isn't it the most beautiful thing you have ever seen?"
EntryText:  You turn to look again at the creature. A mighty arm swings forth, smashing into the water and the ship. As the wave crashes over you and the ship begins to list you start and wake up, still sitting in the chair. 
EntryText:  The fire crackles in the fireplace. Looking down at your hand, for a moment you think you can see the scar, then the moment passes and your hand looks like your own once more.

EntryText:  You laugh out loud gazing up at the marvelous, strange, and alien creature in front of you. You grip the rail and will yourself to stare at it, study it, even though every fiber of your being is telling you to run.
EntryText:  A hand is placed over yours and you look over to see a young woman standing beside you. A look of happiness is etched into her face, and you can't help think it is the first time you have seen her happy in a long time. 
EntryText:  She smiles at you and then turns back to the creature. "Why father, isn't it the most beautiful thing you have ever seen?"
EntryText:  You turn to look again at the creature. A mighty arm swings forth, smashing into the water and the ship. As the wave crashes over you and the ship begins to list you start and wake up, still sitting in the chair.

EntryID:58
EntryText:  You look through the things on the shelves. The jars contain a weird assortment of random things. Most of them look like animal parts, but the names of the animals you don't recognize. You pick one up and shake it slightly and the within the suspension, a claw of some sort rotates slowly into view. Another jar contains what looks to be some sort of eyeball. You tap it and the liquid inside sloshes slightly, causing the eyeball to rotate more toward you.
EntryText:  You move on to the books, and begin to examine them. The collection of title is very odd. References to cryptozoology, mythology, as well as some classics and more modern fare mingle all together in an eclectic collection. The fiction all leans toward the dark side, certainly not the sort of thing you would choose to curl up next to the fire with. One book is older than the rest, and when you flip it open, you don't recognize the symbols that you see within. The pictures inside are of animals you have never seen the like of.

Choice:Examine the book further.

EntryID:59
EntryText:  You take the book over and sit down in the large chair. You imagine that your uncle must have sat here, probably with this very book. The fact that you never knew him and now own this whole place weighs on you for a bit, but then you push the thoughts aside and flip open the book again. 
EntryText:  The symbols still make no sense to you, but you keep flipping through the book, interested nonetheless. The creatures still look alien to you. Finally on one page you find writing that you can read scribbled in the margin next to a large creature which appears to have an octopus for a head.
EntryText:  The note in the margin reads, "The great old ones, like this Cthulhu are considered by most to be nothing but dark stories to scare people. I wonder at the power he is considered to have, and the alien mind he must possess. My research into him continues." 
EntryText:  Not having any idea what the whole book is about, much less the symbols, you close it and reshelve the book.

EntryText:  The only thing not covered in grime or a drop cloth are several old paintings that line one wall. The first painting depicts a man, the second painting a woman, and third painting a young girl.

EntryText:  The painting is a decade or two old. The plaque on the frame below it reads "Gerith Coleman", your uncle. 
EntryText:  He is in a well tailored suit, and holding a pipe. There is a long scar on the back of his hand. He looks very studious and serious, staring out into the room as if watching over his old house.
EntryText:  Not for the first time today you wonder who Gerith Coleman was, and what he was like. Why did your parents never talk of your uncle?

EntryText:  This painting is well taken care of. Unlike the other two, there is very little dirt or dust on the frame or the glass. 
EntryText:  The subject is a younger woman. By the clothing she is wearing, a nice dress, but a bit outdated, you can tell the painting is a few decades old. She is a pretty woman, and seems very happy in the portrait.
EntryText:  A plaque is attached to the frame that reads "Anne Coleman, loving wife". 
EntryText:  This must have been your aunt. She must have passed before your uncle for the house to have gone to you. For a moment you wonder what happened to her.

EntryText:  This painting looks to be about the same age as the painting of the woman, so several decades old. It has been cared for, but still there is some dust and grime on it. 
EntryText:  Depicted in the painting is a young girl, about the age of six. She is dressed in a fine dress, and in one arm she cradles a doll. Both the girl and the doll seem to be staring out at something. Whatever it was seems to have amused the girl, for she has a slight smirk on her face.
EntryText:  Attached to the frame is a small plaque that reads, "Caroline Coleman". Perhaps this was your aunt and uncle's daughter? If so, you wonder what happened to her such that she was not given the house on your uncle's passing. She would have been your cousin. Another relative you did not even know existed. Why did your parents keep this whole part of your family from you?

EntryText:  The blade of the knife is around eight inches long, with an edge on just one side. It sweeps back on the edge side to a sharp point. The back side of the blade has a groove in it. Caked in the groove is what looks to be dried blood.

EntryText:  "Please, Caroline. Just one more time. For me." There is a long pause, then some rustling, before a piano begins to play. The tune is slow, and haunting at first. Then it begins to pick up in tempo.
EntryText:  Caroline whimpers, as the playing seems to get harder. You can hear even through the rough sound of the recording the physical sound of the keys being hammered on. The tempo of the music gets faster, and faster.

Choice:That's enough of that, turn it off.

EntryText:  You yank the arm of the phonograph up, a scratching sound echoes as the needle scrapes the record. 
EntryText:  The silence that follows is almost too completely. The noise that moments ago filled the air seems almost preferable to the sudden silence. 
EntryText:  You realize you had been holding your breath and let it out with a sigh, shaking from your head the thoughts of what you just heard.

Choice:Head through the open door back to the landing.

EntryText:  You can hear now that Caroline is in physical pain as she continues to play. She hammers on the keys, and the music reaches a level of discord and frantic nature.
EntryText:  Louder and louder, faster and faster it goes, when a howling wind is picked up by the recording. "You are doing it Caroline, keep playing!" yells the man's voice. 
EntryText:  She screams over the howling wind and discordant cacophony of the piano. "No! Make it stop! I can't stop!" The howling wind ends with a massive roar, the piano falls silent, Caroline and the man both scream in terror.
EntryText:  There is a horrid crunching noise, and the man's scream ends abruptly. The crunching noises continue along with horrid slurping noises.

EntryText:  "Eat up my darling. Enjoy the meal." She laughs low and begins to play the piano again, this time softly, and almost playfully. The crunching and slurping noises pause for and a soft mewling growl is heard. "Yes, I know. I tried to warn him. But he didn't listen. They never listen."
EntryText:  You swallow hard as the recording ends with Caroline laughing, joined by a deep guttural laugh. The needle finally reaches the end of the record and it begins to skip slowly, scratching noises coming from the phonograph as it continues to spin.
EntryText:  Finally you reach up and lift the arm of the phonograph off, and turn the the phonograph off. Your eyes dart around the room, and you realize you've been holding your breath slightly so you let it out. 
EntryText:  Then you see it. 
EntryText:  In one corner one of the cloths rests over what could only be a piano. You look back down at the massive stain in area in front of the piano. Your mind revolts at the possibilities and you quickly flee the room back to the foyer, trying not to be sick.

EntryText:  The mirror itself has a bit of a wave to the glass and is a bit clouded, so the reflection is a warped and darker version of reality.
EntryText:  You study yourself in the darkened reflection and for a moment you find yourself smirking at the dark image. You imagine yourself a dark god, watching over his people.

EntryText:  You look at the side of the mirror where you pricked yourself and see a small drop of blood on the sharp little point of a small creatures fangs. The blood dissappears into the creatures mouth, rolling out of sight. You begin to feel slightly uneasy, as if the world is shifting. You grab a different part of the mirror to hold yourself steady, and feel the metal moving beneath your hand.

EntryText:  Whoever it is, they apparently scare your uncle, because he talks about installing protections from outsiders like 'them'. He talks of 'they' want what he acquired, and he rails against the unfairness enacted upon him by 'them' when all he wants is to be left alone.

EntryText:  The city is built of strange angles and bizarre shapes that make your mind race and hurt. They are not logical or possible. Fish swim through the streets and a massive shark darts about making a meal of anything it can catch. You realize the city is in the depths of the ocean, no wonder it is so dark.

EntryText:  The light darts into the roil of bubbles, and again you follow down into the depths passed the massive door in the ground.

Suddenly the shark disentegrates in a sudden puff of bone and blood as if it just ran into something that obliterated it utterly. 
EntryText:  You can not help but gasp when the shark is destroyed. Water rushes into your mouth, you gag, you feel as if you are going to drown.
EntryText:  The massive slumbering creature senses your distress, though you do not know how something as small as you could disturb something so big. Its eyes snap open and there is a howling wail that pierces the water. You struggle to turn and swim away. The tentacles lash out grabbing for you.

You catch sight of yourself in the large mirror, you look like you are dripping wet. Your hair is matted to your head, seaweed dangles from your shoulders. 
EntryText:  Screaming in terror you stand up quickly, feeling your clothing and tearing at where you saw the seaweed. You find yourself to be perfectly dry. There is no seaweed. When you look back at the mirror now you are dry as a bone. You swallow away the fear and look back at the bed, shaking your head slightly.

EntryText:  Minutes later, James comes out, dragging the barking dog with him. "Sorry, whoever or whatever it was is gone now. The back door wasn't locked up, so maybe they got out that way while we were out here." He shrugs a bit, but looks like he is telling you the truth. Besides, if James had it out for you, his axe and dog could have let him act on it long ago.

EntryText:  Two places within town immediately come to mind. The library and the Arkham Advertiser, the local newspaper. Either might have more information.
EntryText:  At the library, you know you can pour over many old texts about Arkham and its surroundings. It would take some time, but nothing some dogged determination can't handle.
EntryText:  The Arkham Advertiser on the other hand means dealing with the local reporters, editors, or archivists. Getting them to give up information when there is no story to be had will take some convincing.
EntryText:  Of course, you are burning daylight, and you have a bit of a drive ahead of you. Perhaps it would best to skip all this and head out to the house. After all, it is just a house, what more would you need to know than that?

Choice:Nevermind the research. You decide to head out to the house.
Action:GOTO:20
Choice:The library sounds up your speed with its dusty old tomes and research.
Action:GOTO:2
Choice:The Arkham Advertiser is the better choice. If there is information to be had, reporters will know!

EntryID:2
Note:Library
EntryText:  You pull up outside the library and step out of your car, just as a thunderclap sounds overhead. Dark storm clouds have been gathering all morning and it looks like they will finally let loose the rain soon.
EntryText:  Managing to get inside just before the rain hits, you settle into to dig through the ancient books and periodicals. The hours go by, and most of what you find is rather dull. Nothing really sparks your interest immediately.
EntryText:  You are reshelving a book on the history of Arkham and its surrounding areas when you get the feeling that something is watching you. You turn to look, but nothing is there but rows upon rows of books. 
EntryText:  Shaking off the feeling you dive back into the search, hoping that something fruitful will turn up soon.

EntryID:3
Note:Library Success
EntryText:  You find one interesting article tucked away in the archives. It is from five years back. Apparently your uncle paid a large sum to Miskatonic University for them to perform an archaeological dig on his land. 
EntryText:  It turns out the land was a former native burial ground. The dig was mildly successful in uncovering several artifacts including a ceremonial mask. 
EntryText:  Unfortunately, before the dig could be completed, things started going wrong. First there was an accident on the site. Then several of the key artifacts were stolen. Eventually your uncle decided to stop funding the dig.

Choice:This was interesting, but its time to get out of here.
Action:GOTO:5

EntryText:  As you reshelve the final book you turn to find a man standing in the shadows of the rack of books ahead of you. Shadows cover his features, and he slowly shakes his head. 
EntryText:  Lightning flashes, and when his face is illuminated, it is a horror to behold. The eyes are sunken in, the skin is taut, and his lips are pulled back in a snarl. You start back as the lightning flash fades and run into a librarian walking through the stacks.
EntryText:  She starts as you bump into her and says, "Oh, terribly sorry. Are you alright?"
EntryText:  You look back to where the figure was standing, but he is gone. Swallowing away the fear, you shake your head and straight your clothes, "Yes, fine, thank you. Excuse me."

EntryText:  You race to the door, the rain slicking your hair to your head. As you get to the door a woman opens it for your from the inside and smiles, "Quickly, come in!" She laughs gently at your condition and waits for you to gather yourself before saying, "Welcome to the Arkham Advertiser. I'm Julie, the editor of the paper. What can I do for you?"

EntryText:  "It's okay. I didn't really know him. The thing is, he left me the property, and I have no idea what I am getting into."
EntryText:  Julie nods, then leans back in her chair and taps her fingers on the edge of her desk. "As I said, the area is very remote. We could go and check in the archives though. Perhaps we can find something there."
EntryText:  She stands and strides toward the door, grabbing an old massive set of keys on a large key ring from one corner of her desk.

EntryText:  Julie looks you up and down a moment then shrugs, "I can't really say. I don't know anything about that area." She stands, "Now if you will excuse me, I have work to do."

Choice:You leave Julie's office, disappointed.

EntryText:  You lie to Julie. "I was taking a long drive out that direction the other day, and I saw an old house out there. I wondered what its story was."
EntryText:  Julie nods slowly, "Strange place for a drive, but okay." She leans back in her chair and taps her fingers on the edge of her desk. "As I said, the area is very remote. We could go and check in the archives though. Perhaps we can find something there."

EntryText:  You lie to Julie. "I was taking a long drive out that direction the other day, and I saw an old house out there. I wondered what its story was."
EntryText:  Julie's eyebrows raise and she looks at you a long moment. "Strange place for a drive." She taps her fingers on the edge of her desk, then shrugs, "I wish I could help you. But that area is very remote. Not much news comes out of that area I am afraid."
EntryText:  She stands and smiles at you. "I appreciate you coming in though. Now if you will excuse me. I have a paper to edit." She walks you to the door of her office, and closes it quietly behind you. 

Choice:You leave Julie's office, disappointed.
Action:GOTO:17


EntryID:16
EntryText:  The archive is in the basement, and Julie clicks on the lights as you head down. They don't really do much to dispel the gloom downstairs, but at least you don't run into things. Julie walks over to one door, and uses one of the keys on a massive keyring to unlatch the heavy old door. 
EntryText:  Once it is open she slips in, clicking on another light, then turns to rows and rows of boxes. "Let's see. I think... ah yes. Here we go." She pulls a box off one shelf and starts leafing through things. "I remember there was something out there several years back. Had to do with the University." She flips through many sheafs of paper before finally stopping on one and handing it to you. "There you go."
EntryText:  The article outlines how your uncle paid for an archaeological dig on his land. Apparently a prehistoric burial ground was located in the woods behind the house, and your uncle worked with Miskatonic University to have it excavated. The dig went well for a while, producing several rare artifacts, including a ceremonial mask. Things started to fall apart though, after an accident at the dig site left one worker dead, and a break in at Miskatonic University resulted in the theft of most of the major artifacts. Your Uncle pulled the plug after that.

EntryText:  Julie smiles, "I wish I had more for you, but that is really all the detail there is from then."
EntryText:  You go over the article one more time, scanning for anything else that will tell you anything, but it is mostly generalities and reactions from locals and University officials.
EntryText:  "I really appreciate this, Julie." You smile and hand her back the article. She refiles it, then clicks the light off as you both turn to walk out of the archives. 
EntryText:  "I hope it was enough. I appreciate you stopping by, but I really need to get back to work." She offers you a hand which you take, and then turns to walk away.

Choice:You head out.
Action:GOTO:17


EntryID:17
EntryText:  You step out into the rain and begin toward your car. Glancing to one side, you see a shadow slip back into an alleyway beside the paper. Something tells you, whoever it was, they were watching you.
EntryText:  Slamming your car door shut, you start the car and drive passed the alley. Standing in the back of the alley, drenched in rain and covered in shadow is a hooded figure, watching you intently. You stop the car, and step out, determined to confront the man. 
EntryText:  Lightning flashes, and in the brighter light, you swear that the man's face is covered in something. The eyes are massive, the lips curled in a snarl. It must be a mask. Right?
EntryText:  As you eyes readjust to the light, you step forward, "You there!" You begin toward the figure just as they turn to one side, running from sight. You make the corner fast enough, feet splashing through the puddles as you run. 
EntryText:  When you turn the corner though, no one is there. You look up the sides of the buildings, and back the way you came, but see no signs of the masked figure. 

Choice:You take a breath, then head back to your car and out of the rain.
Action:GOTO:20

EntryText:  "Thank you so much, you are too kind." You look around her office as she closes the door. "Nice office you have here, Julie. You must work very hard."
EntryText:  Julie smiles her appreciation and nods, "I do. It's not easy to get ahead in this business, but my family has owned the Advertiser for generations, so I guess it is just in my blood."
EntryText:  You nod, "Well family business or not, I can tell you care for it." 
EntryText:  "Enough about me, what can I do for you?" She settles into her office chair. 
EntryText:  "I am interested in the history of the area out off of Old Hill Rd. I was hoping with your connections you might be able to help me."
EntryText:  "I am familiar with the area, yes." She stands and grabs a large ring of keys off her desk. "Let's go down to the archives and see what I can dig up."

Choice:You follow Julie to the archives.

EntryText:  "Thank you so much, you are too kind." You look around her office as she closes the door. "Nice office you have here, Julie. How's someone like you get this?"
EntryText:  Julie frowns, "Like me?"
EntryText:  You try to correct for your obvious mistake. "I just didn't expect the editor of the local paper to be..."
EntryText:  Julie cuts you off, "My family has owned the paper for generations. I grew up here, and I'm the best one qualified to run it."
EntryText:  "Of course, I didn't mean to offend. I was just surprised." Julie regards you a long moment before leaning back and sighing. 
EntryText:  "It's alright. I get it a lot. I do have a lot of work to do though, so I am afraid you will have to excuse me." she stands and opens her office door, clearly ending the conversation.

Choice:You leave Julie's office, disappointed at your lack of progress.

EntryText:  You fire up the old oil lantern and begin down the ladder. It is slow going, having to hold the lantern and make your way down at the same time, but you manage without spilling the oil from the lantern or burning yourself. When you get to the bottom of the shaft you see it opens up behind you, and turn slowly around.
EntryText:  The stone chamber before you makes your skin crawl just by looking at it. Dark stains mar the stone surface in various locations. A massive table, stained dark and crusted with unknown substances sits in the middle of the room. Mounted onto the corner of the table are sets of metal cuffs. In one wall, manacles are attached to a large metal ring. The inside of the manacles are set with two inch spikes, and crusted with more dark stains.
EntryText:  In the opposite wall a large metal grate separates you from a second ladder. 
EntryText:  In one corner an old doll sits propped up, head lolled to one side. Its lifeless eyes stare in the direction of the grated doorway.

EntryText:  You step slowly up to the table and look at it closer. Small troughs run through the tables top, all seeming to run down a hole in one of the legs. The metal cuffs seem fairly well embedded in the corners, you give one a good yank and feel that there would be no getting out of them if you were bound into them.
EntryText:  Noting were all the troughs lead you push the table, and after a grunt and bit of effort, you feel it slide ever so slightly. A small hole is built under the one leg, leading down under the bricks of the floor. The hole is coated in the same crusted dark stain that mars the rest of the room.

EntryText:  The soft noise of children's laughter fills the room. You snap your head up and look around and your eyes go to the doll. It is still sitting in the corner, but its head has turned and is looking straight at you. 
EntryText:  As quickly as it started the laughter ends and then with a loud grinding noise, the metal grate over the far door begins to slowly raise.  You tear a bit of your shirt off and wrap your hand, then pick the lantern back up and move toward the door.
EntryText:  Then you notice that the doll has moved. Its not in the corner any more, but laying on the table beside you. Though it is flat on its back on the table, its head is turned in your direction.

EntryText:  More children's laughter rings out, and you glance back at the doll. It is standing on the table now, staring straight at you.
EntryText:  You realize you took your eyes off the manacles too late. They slap around your wrists, the spikes piercing your skin. Your screams echo through the chamber, mixing with the laughter of the children.
